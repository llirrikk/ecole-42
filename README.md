### 42cursus (the main part of the entire course)
#### [Libft](/42cursus/Libft)
> This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus.

```trace
initial_errors:  | test_ft_isalnum: OK | test_ft_isalpha: OK | test_ft_isascii: OK | test_ft_isdigit: OK | test_ft_isprint: OK | test_ft_atoi: OK | test_ft_bzero: OK | test_ft_calloc: OK | test_ft_itoa: OK | test_ft_memchr: OK | test_ft_memcmp: OK | test_ft_memcpy: OK | test_ft_memmove: OK | test_ft_memset: OK | test_ft_putchar_fd: OK | test_ft_putendl_fd: OK | test_ft_putnbr_fd: OK | test_ft_putstr_fd: OK | test_ft_split: OK | test_ft_strchr: OK | test_ft_strdup: OK | test_ft_strjoin: OK | test_ft_strlcat: OK | test_ft_strlcpy: OK | test_ft_strlen: OK | test_ft_strmapi: OK | test_ft_striteri: OK | test_ft_strncmp: OK | test_ft_strnstr: OK | test_ft_strrchr: OK | test_ft_strtrim: OK | test_ft_substr: OK | test_ft_tolower: OK | test_ft_toupper: OK | bonus: 9/9 functions correct
```
_Result: 125%_



#### [get_next_line](/42cursus/get_next_line)
> May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.

```trace
basic_tests: GNL OK | bonus_tests: GNL OK
```
_Result: 125%_



#### [ft_printf](/42cursus/ft_printf)
> This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.

```trace
test_spdxiucpercent: 8/8 correct functions | bonus_one: KO (Does not compile) | bonus_two: KO (Does not compile)
```
_Result: 100%_



#### [Born2beRoot](/42cursus/Born2beRoot)
> This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.

_Result: 125%_



#### [so_long](/42cursus/so_long)
> This project is a small 2D game with [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux). You'll learn about textures, sprites and tiles.

_Result: 125%_



#### [push_swap](/42cursus/push_swap)
> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

_Result: 125%_



#### [pipex](/42cursus/pipex)
> This project aims to make you understand a bit deeper two concepts from UNIX mechanism that you already know: the redirections and the pipes. It is an introduction project.

_Result: 100%_



#### [Philosophers](/42cursus/Philosophers)
> In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes.

_Result: 125%_



#### [miniRT](/42cursus/miniRT)
> This project is an introduction to the beautiful world of Raytracing. Once completed you will be able to render simple Computer-Generated-Images and you will never be afraid of implementing mathematical formulas again.

_Result: 103%_
